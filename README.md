## [What is C++ ?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

C++ is a [general-purpose programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_programming_language) created by [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjarne_Stroustrup) as an extension of the [C programming language](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>), or "C with [Classes](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)>)". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), [generic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_programming), and [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) features in addition to facilities for [low-level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language) [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory) manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide [C++ compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_compilers#C.2B.2B_compilers), including the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation), LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
